    \textbf{Digital comunication}
    \\

    Digital comunication is based on wave signals comunications. When having this kind of signals we can compute:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Energy of the wave:
            \[
            E[J] = \int_{d1}^{d2}  \,dx  \frac{s^2(t)}{R} \, dt
            \]
        
        Being: 
        \begin{enumerate}[label=\textbullet]
            \item d1 = starting distance of the signal.
            \item d2 = ending distance of the signal.
            \item $s(t) = \text{equation of the signal in function of time. Usually: } A\cos(2\pi f_c T)$
            \item R = resistance. Usually 50 $\Omega$
          \end{enumerate}
          

        \item Power Transmited [W]:
            \[\frac{E}{D} \]
            Being: 
            \begin{enumerate}[label=\textbullet]
                \item E = energy of the wave.
                \item D = distance of the wave = (d2-d1)
              \end{enumerate}

        \item Power Received:
        \begin{enumerate}[label=\textbullet]
            \item $[W]$:    $\frac{Pt[W]}{L \text{ (Loss of the channel)}}$
            \item $[dBW]$:  $Pt[dBW] - L[dB]$
            \item $[dBm]$:  $Pt[dBm] - L[dB]$
          \end{enumerate}
          
      \end{enumerate}

      \vspace{1cm}

      \textbf{Data Rate:} Number of information bits per second transmitted.
      
      \textbf{Bit Rate:} Number of bits per second transmitted when source is active.

      \textbf{User Throughput (U):} Number of information bits per second received.

      \textbf{Bit Error Rate (BER):} Percentage of erroneous bits.

      \textbf{Block Error Rate (BER):} Percentage of erroneous data blocks.

      \textbf{Energy Efficiency (EE):} Number of information bits received per joule.
      \begin{center} $E = E1 + E2 + E3 + E4$ \end{center}

      Being: 
      \begin{enumerate}[label=\textbullet]
          \item E1 = energy consumed by the source.
          \item E2 = energy consumed by the transmitter.
          \item E3 = energy consumed by the receiver.
          \item E4 = energy consumed by the destination.
        \end{enumerate}
         \textcolor{red}{E3 and E4 are neglictable if the device is connected to the electric grid}
